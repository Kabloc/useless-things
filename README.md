# Useless-things

As the name already say, things with really low utility, just tests... :+1:

### Sudoku:

A child play, at my university in 2007, we did a challenge between the students: Who is able to do an algorithm that solves a sudoku table?

That challenge made me play sudoku for a long time, to understand how my brain works to solve it.
When you look at a space on sudoku table you have to think about:

* Line
* Column 
* Square

So I thought, always when you set a number on table space, all spaces (in line, column and square) have to know. Read the code and see how I thought to do that. :simple_smile: 

### Evaluation:


I decided to make an evaluation for simple mathematical expressions with only the four basic operations (+, -, *, /) and parentheses.
